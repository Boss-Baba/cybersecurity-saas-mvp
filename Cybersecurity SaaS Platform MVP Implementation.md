# Cybersecurity SaaS Platform MVP Implementation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) implementation for the Cybersecurity SaaS Platform targeting SMEs and Fintech companies. The platform addresses multiple threat vectors and compliance requirements, including sophisticated phishing, AI-powered malware, zero-day vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, insider threats, cloud misconfigurations, ransomware, DDoS attacks, prompt injection attacks, and more.

## Architecture

The MVP follows a modern web application architecture:

1. **Backend**: Flask (Python) with SQLAlchemy ORM
2. **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
3. **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, jQuery, Chart.js
4. **Authentication**: Flask-Login with role-based access control
5. **Security**: CSRF protection, input validation, secure headers

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. User & Organization Management
- Multi-tenant architecture with organization-level isolation
- Role-based access control (user, admin)
- User invitation and management
- Profile and account settings

### 2. Threat Detection & Response
- Threat dashboard with severity-based categorization
- Threat details and investigation
- Threat containment and remediation workflow
- Threat simulation for testing

### 3. Vulnerability Management
- Vulnerability scanning and discovery
- Vulnerability assessment and prioritization
- Remediation tracking and verification
- CVE database integration

### 4. Compliance Management
- Framework-based compliance assessments (GDPR, PCI DSS)
- Control implementation tracking
- Compliance reporting and gap analysis
- Evidence collection and documentation

### 5. Asset Management
- Asset discovery and inventory
- Asset categorization and criticality assessment
- Asset-to-vulnerability mapping
- Asset-to-threat correlation

### 6. Security Awareness
- Phishing simulation campaigns

### 7. Dashboard & Reporting
- Security score calculation
- Threat and vulnerability trends
- Compliance status visualization
- Risk assessment overview

## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following key models:

1. **User Model**: Authentication and user management
2. **Organization Model**: Multi-tenant support
3. **Asset Model**: Asset inventory and management
4. **Threat Model**: Threat detection and response
5. **Vulnerability Model**: Vulnerability management
6. **Compliance Models**: Framework, control, and assessment
7. **Security Event Model**: Event logging and monitoring
8. **Phishing Simulation Models**: Campaign and target management

## API Endpoints

The MVP includes RESTful API endpoints for:

1. **Authentication**: Login, logout, token management
2. **Threats**: List, view, update, simulate
3. **Vulnerabilities**: List, view, update, scan
4. **Compliance**: Frameworks, controls, assessments
5. **Assets**: Inventory, management
6. **Statistics**: Dashboard data and reporting
